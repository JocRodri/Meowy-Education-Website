This readme is for my homepage.html titled Meowy Education.

This homepage.html will have a header, image, aside, and an article. These will all be displayed correctly when shown with the CSS page. 
With just the HTML file alone, this will output the header, the image, the article, and the categories I have made. 
The header should read Meowy Education, and the photo should be of a cat in a box. 
Everything is just for show, except for the categories. Each of the categories will take you to the corresponding page when clicked on. 
The categories are Homepage, which will not work from the Homepage, Cat Toys, About Me, and References. 
I plan on making more categories as I expand my website.


This readme is for my cat_toys.html titled Cat Toys.

This cat_toys.html will have a header, image, aside, table, and an article. These will all be displayed correctly when shown with the CSS page. 
With just the HTML file alone, this will output the header, the image, the article, the table, and the categories I have made. 
The header should read Cat Toys, and the photo should be of random cat toys.
Everything is just for show, except for the categories. Each of the categories will take you to the corresponding page when clicked on. 
The table should display two columns, one for dos and one for don'ts of cat toys. I decided to keep them all in the same row since I felt it looked cleaner.
The categories are Homepage, Cat Toys, About Me, and References. Cat Toys link will not work if you are already on that page.


This readme is for my about_me.html titled About Me.

This about_me.html will have a header, image, aside, video, email link, and an article. These will all be displayed correctly when shown with the CSS page. 
With just the HTML file alone, this will output the header, the image, the article, the video, the email link and the categories I have made. 
The header should read About Me, and the photo should be of me(Jocelyn) and my cat(Nessie).
Everything is just for show, except for the categories, email link, and video. Each of the categories will take you to the corresponding page when clicked on. The video will play if you click to play it, and it is of my cat grooming herself. The email link is connected to my email and will allow you to email me if clicked on. 
The categories are Homepage, Cat Toys, About Me, and References. About Me link will not work if you are already on that page. 


This readme is for my references.html titled References.

This references.html will have a header, image, aside, links, and an article.
These will all be displayed correctly when shown with the CSS page.

The header should read References, and the photo should be of paper and a book.
Everything is just for show, except for the links and the categories. Each of the categories will take you to the corresponding page when clicked on. 
The links should open up a new webpage for that specific link when clicked on.
The categories are Homepage, Cat Toys, About Me, and References. Reference link will not work if you are already on that page. 

This readme is for my style.css that goes with my website. 
My CSS file helps style my body, headers, articles, aside, links, and centers my images.
For the body, it sets the background image for all the pages, and keeps it fixed even when scrolling. 
The header CSS code sets the font size, style, and color. It also keeps it fixed at the tope of each screen. The article CSS and aside CSS also do the same thing. The aside also creates a border around my categories. I used a purplish color for my aside and header. For my article CSS code, I removed the line that forms under the links and also changed it to the purplish color. The last thing my CSS code does is creates a border around the table in my cat_toys.html page.
