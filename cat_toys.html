		When owning a cat, it is a given that they will want some sort of entertainment. 
		We love to spoil our pets with toys, but it is important to make sure that the toys we buy are safe for our cats.
		On this page, I have compiled a list of dos and don'ts for cat toys. 
		</p>
		<!--This code is to help the website user understand what this page and table are about-->
		
		<table style="width:100%">
		<!--This creates the table initially-->
			<tr>
				<th>Dos</th>
				<th>Don'ts</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>-Simple designs without parts or pieces that can come off <br> -Made with non-toxic materials <br> -Small stuffed animals without beaded eyes</td>
				<td>-Toys with sharp edges <br> -Strings <br> -Feathers <br> -Foam <br> -Rubber bands or elastic <br> -Toys with parts that can come off</td>
			</tr>
		<!--This code is used to create a table. It created my two columns, and two rows. <th> created the table headers, and <td> created the placeholder for the second row of information.
		I used the <br> code to keep the table looking cleaner-->
