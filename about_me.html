		My name is Jocelyn Rodriguez, and I am a big cat lover. I rescued my cat Nessie off the streets about two years ago, and we have been inseparable ever since.
		I love my cat, but not having experience owning a cat, I had a lot to learn about them. I decided to create this website to help other cat owners have easy access to learning more about their pets.
		I hope you enjoy my website!
